# AI Agent for CV

## Project Overview
This repository is a fork of crewAI-examples. The original project focuses on defining custom agents, tasks, and managing crews as described below:

- **agents.py:** Contains the definitions for custom agents, including their role, backstory, goal, available tools (optional), and delegation capabilities.
- **task.py:** Contains the definitions for custom tasks, including a task description, the assigned agent, and the expected output.
- **crew (main.py):** Acts as the main file to run your custom crew by combining agents, tasks, and various parameters like verbosity and debug mode.

The fork was created to develop functionality for writing CV.
